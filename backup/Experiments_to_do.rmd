Add the experiments we have to perform in the next few days (The minimum experiments we have to perform so that we can be in a good shape for poster presentation):
1) <b>Experiment with the number of training examples and test accuracy</b> - ~ 100 runs for each # of training examples: do this for each subject id combination and single task learning

2) <b>Experiments with alpha matrix: </b> 
  a) Keep the alpha matrix constant
  b) Replace it with MMD
  c) Initialise it with MMD
  c) Constraint the alpha matrix to be symmetric 
  d) Contraint its sum to be one in each row
  e) Keep it trainable with no limitations
  f) Try to increase the dimension of alpha_matrix beyond two 

3) Play with the MNIST dataset and create a clean test and training dataset from it
