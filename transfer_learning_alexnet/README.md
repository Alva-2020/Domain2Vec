To run this code, download the workspace directory from https://umich.box.com/shared/static/mlubdi20y8ef2ldqf16t4iu7w8icnceg.zip and extract it one folder above in DeepMultiTaskLearning folder. 

The AlexNet weights are taken from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/bvlc_alexnet.npy and PACS dataset link https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6x7gtvErXgfUU1WcGY5SzdwZVk 

Make sure 'data_dir' points to correct workspace directory path for PACS dataset and bvlc_alexnet.npy path if stored in any place other than the currect directory.
